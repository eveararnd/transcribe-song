# Gemma 3 12B Status Report

## Current Situation

### 1. Model Downloaded
- Successfully cloned `google/gemma-3-12b-it` from HuggingFace as requested
- All model files present (5 safetensors files totaling ~23GB)
- Location: `/home/davegornshtein/parakeet-tdt-deployment/gemma-3-12b-it`

### 2. Loading Works
- Model loads successfully using transformers library
- Uses eager attention (not flash_attention_2) for compatibility
- Occupies ~23GB GPU memory when loaded

### 3. Generation Fails
- **Error**: `CUDA error: device-side assert triggered`
- **Specific issue**: `probability tensor contains either inf, nan or element < 0`
- **Location**: Occurs during `torch.multinomial` sampling in text generation
- Error happens with both the downloaded model and the cloned repository

### 4. PyTorch Implementation Status
- Cloned `gemma_pytorch` repository as requested
- The library has incomplete support for Gemma 3:
  - `Gemma3ForMultimodalLM` class exists
  - But `GemmaModel` base class doesn't handle `Architecture.GEMMA_3`
  - Results in "Unknown architecture" error

## Root Cause Analysis

The CUDA error during generation suggests:
1. Numerical instability in the model outputs
2. Possible issues with:
   - Temperature/sampling parameters
   - Model precision (float16 vs float32)
   - Attention implementation
   - GPU memory constraints

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✓ Used eager attention instead of flash_attention_2
2. ✓ Cleared CUDA cache before loading
3. ✓ Tried different prompts
4. ✗ PyTorch implementation - incomplete for Gemma 3

## Recommendations

1. **For the CUDA error**: Try adjusting generation parameters:
   - Lower temperature (e.g., 0.1)
   - Use greedy decoding instead of sampling
   - Try float32 precision
   - Use CPU inference (slower but might work)

2. **For gemma_pytorch**: The library needs updates to support Gemma 3 architecture

3. **Alternative**: Consider using the model through official Google APIs or wait for library updates
