### Test Categories

#### System Tests (`tests/system/`)
- `test_existing_catalog.py`: ✅ 1/1 passed
- `test_music_analyzer_api.py`: ✅ 20/21 passed (1 skipped)
  - Authentication tests: ✅ Passing
  - Utility functions: ✅ Passing
  - API endpoints: ✅ Passing (1 skipped - requires DB)
  - Export functionality: ✅ Passing
  - Storage management: ✅ Passing
  - Search functionality: ✅ Passing
  - Error handling: ✅ Passing

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
- `test_export_functionality_mock.py`: ✅ 3/3 passed
- `test_export_simple.py`: ✅ 1/1 passed
- `test_faiss_integration.py`: ✅ 1/1 passed
- `test_lyrics_search.py`: ✅ 1/1 passed

#### Model Tests (`tests/model/`)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Cannot run - GPU out of memory
- **Note**: These tests require significant GPU memory and are designed for production environments

#### Component Tests (`tests/component/`)
- `test_v2_endpoints.py`: Ready for integration testing when API is running

### Known Issues
1. **Database Connection**: One test skipped as it requires a running PostgreSQL database
2. **GPU Memory**: Model tests cannot run due to GPU memory constraints
3. **Deprecated Warnings**: Several datetime.utcnow() deprecation warnings (non-critical)

### Achievements
1. ✅ Fixed all UI test failures
2. ✅ Eliminated all React warnings
3. ✅ Upgraded React Router from v6 to v7
4. ✅ Fixed Python test infrastructure
5. ✅ Organized tests into proper directories
6. ✅ Achieved 96.4% overall test pass rate

### Next Steps
1. Fix deprecated datetime warnings by using `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`
2. Set up database for integration tests
3. Run model tests on systems with more GPU memory
4. Add more unit tests for better coverage
